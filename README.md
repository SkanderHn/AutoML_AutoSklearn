# AutoML_AutoSklearn
Testing some Auto-ML libraries for fun

In these notebooks, I am testing the [Auto-Sklearn](https://www.automl.org/automl/auto-sklearn/) auto-ML library, which is in turn based on scikit-learn. 
Examples studied so far: 
The Titanic data set from Kaggle: Can auto-sklearn get a competitive score on the leader board?
